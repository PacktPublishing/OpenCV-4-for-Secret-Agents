## About the Video Course
OpenCV is a grand collection of image processing functions and computer vision algorithms. Not only is it open source, it also supports many programming platforms and is fast enough for many real-time applications.Â 

This course is designed in an unconventional way to help you get started with OpenCV 4 in an easy and creative manner. Taking inspiration from the world of spies, this video course will add a spark of adventure and computer vision to your daily routine.

You'll embark on this course tasked with finding out how many gadgets you can integrate and, with this handy library, you'll build cool exciting out-of-the-box projects!

By the end of this course, you will be confident enough as a Secret Agent to develop computer vision applications never seen before in the real world, taking your lead from James Bond and the Mission Impossible franchise.
